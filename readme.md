# Template notebook

This is a template notebook used for mySociety data science projects.

You only update this repo, and don't clone directly from it. See instructions in [this repo](https://github.com/mysociety/python-data-auto-template) on how to use it as a template for new projects.

Pull requests for this repo will run a test that it can be re-converted back into the template repo. 

Instructions on using the features of this notebook are available in [data-repo-readme.md](https://github.com/mysociety/data_common/blob/main/data-repo-readme.md).
