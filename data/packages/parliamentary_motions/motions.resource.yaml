    example: "  Question put (Standing Order No. 31(2)), That the original words stand\
      \ part of the Question.\nAmendment:\nI beg to move an amendment, to leave out\
      \ from \"House\" to the end of the Question and add:\n\"notes the appalling\
      \ fiscal deficit left by the last Government and reiterates the urgent need\
      \ to restore the nation to economic health; recognises that the police will\
      \ need to play their part in reducing that deficit; and welcomes the Government's\
      \ proposed policing reforms, which will deliver a more responsive and efficient\
      \ police service, less encumbered by bureaucracy, more accountable to the public\
      \ and, most importantly, better equipped to fight crime.\"\nOriginal words:\n\
      I beg to move,\nThat this House notes with concern the Government's failure\
      \ to prioritise the safety of communities by not protecting central Government\
      \ funding for the police; notes the conclusion of the Audit Commission and HM\
      \ Inspectorate of Constabulary that any budget reduction over 12 per cent. will\
      \ reduce frontline policing; pays tribute to the police and other agencies for\
      \ achieving a 43 per cent. reduction in crime, including a 42 per cent. cut\
      \ in violent crime, since 1997, and for maintaining that reduction through last\
      \ year's recession; notes that public perception of anti-social behaviour is\
      \ at its lowest level since it was recorded in the British Crime Survey of 2001-02;\
      \ further notes that the previous Government set out plans in its Policing White\
      \ Paper to drive down policing costs whilst maintaining core funding; and condemns\
      \ the Government's policy of reducing police numbers, restricting police powers\
      \ and imposing elected commissioners to replace police authorities, thus condemning\
      \ the police service to unnecessary, unwelcome and costly re-structuring at\
      \ a time when their focus should be on maintaining the fall in crime and anti-social\
      \ behaviour."
