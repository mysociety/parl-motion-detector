        \ leave out from \"House\" to the end of the Question and add:\n\"notes the\
        \ appalling fiscal deficit left by the last Government and reiterates the\
        \ urgent need to restore the nation to economic health; recognises that the\
        \ police will need to play their part in reducing that deficit; and welcomes\
        \ the Government's proposed policing reforms, which will deliver a more responsive\
        \ and efficient police service, less encumbered by bureaucracy, more accountable\
        \ to the public and, most importantly, better equipped to fight crime.\"\n\
        Original words:\nI beg to move,\nThat this House notes with concern the Government's\
        \ failure to prioritise the safety of communities by not protecting central\
        \ Government funding for the police; notes the conclusion of the Audit Commission\
        \ and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary that any budget reduction over 12 per\
        \ cent. will reduce frontline policing; pays tribute to the police and other\
        \ agencies for achieving a 43 per cent. reduction in crime, including a 42\
        \ per cent. cut in violent crime, since 1997, and for maintaining that reduction\
        \ through last year's recession; notes that public perception of anti-social\
        \ behaviour is at its lowest level since it was recorded in the British Crime\
        \ Survey of 2001-02; further notes that the previous Government set out plans\
        \ in its Policing White Paper to drive down policing costs whilst maintaining\
        \ core funding; and condemns the Government's policy of reducing police numbers,\
        \ restricting police powers and imposing elected commissioners to replace\
        \ police authorities, thus condemning the police service to unnecessary, unwelcome\
        \ and costly re-structuring at a time when their focus should be on maintaining\
        \ the fall in crime and anti-social behaviour."
